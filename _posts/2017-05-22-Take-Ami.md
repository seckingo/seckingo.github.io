# Very basic daily AWS AMI generator.

Just put this sample line down on a .txt file as many times as you want a and save it as .bat file. You can put this down on a aws cli installed server and set a schedule to it.

aws ec2 create-image --instance-id i-********** --name "Any name you want to define your snapshot" --no-reboot
